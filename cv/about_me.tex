\cvsection{About me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Theoretical physicist with heavy mathematical and statistical 
background, smart at problem-solving, skilled and truly passionate in software engineering, with almost 10 years of professional experience in industry, always looking for optimal tradeoffs between engineering and business.

  For the past several years, I have been working as technical lead and senior Scala software engineer in cross-functional product teams, working in tandem with the product, designing and delivering by myself a number of business-critical backend systems, fostering  across the organisation a genuine culture of pragmatism, incremental development, accountability, ownership, and leveraging strong engineering skills 
 % design principles, functional programming, CI/CD practices, telemetry, TDD and more 
  to drive the development of production-grade systems at scale. Fast feedback loop is not just a good practice for me: it has always been part of my lifestyle.

  My current interests range from strongly statically typed purely functional programming, to concurrency and distributed systems, to formal specification tools like TLA+, to Bayesian inference. These are (among others) not just intellectual curiosities, but weapons in my toolkit to deliver confidently robust, reliable, correct, extendable, software at pace. 

My background as a physicist, my diversified experiences and my strategic thinking make me a valuable asset to approach challenging and ambitious tasks. I'm looking for adventures where I can solve real problems and where I can grow and learn new things while helping the business and the team to successfully achieve their goals.
