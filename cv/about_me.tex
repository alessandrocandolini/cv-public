\cvsection{About me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Theoretical physicist with heavy mathematical and statistical 
background, smart at problem-solving, passionate and skilled in software engineering, with almost 10 years of experience in this industry. 
I'm always looking for the the best tradeoffs between engineering and business needs, and I see engineering as a partner of business. 

  Over the past years I have been working as technical lead and senior Scala software engineer in cross-functional product teams, working in tandem with the product, designing and implementing by myself a number of business-critical backend systems, always encouraging across the organisation a culture of pragmatism, incrementality, accountability, ownership, and leveraging strong engineering skills 
 % design principles, functional programming, CI/CD practices, telemetry, TDD and more 
  to drive the development of production-grade systems at scale. 

  My current interests range from strongly statically typed purely functional programming to concurrency and distributed systems, to formal specification tools like TLA+, to Bayesian inference. These are (among others) not just intellectual curiosities, but weapons in my toolkit to deliver confidently robust reliable correct software at pace. 

My background as a physicist, my diversified experiences and my strategic thinking make me a valuable asset to approach challenging and ambitious tasks. I'm looking for adventures where I can apply my favourite techniques to solve real problems and where i can grow and learn new stuff while helping the business and the team to successfully achieve their goals.
