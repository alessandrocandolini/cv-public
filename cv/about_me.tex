\cvsection{About me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Theoretical physicist with strong mathematical and statistical 
background, smart at problem-solving, skilled and truly passionate in software engineering, with almost 10 years of professional experience in industry. Goal-oriented and delivery-focused, I see technology as a business enabler. I am always looking for optimal tradeoffs between engineering and product.

  For the past several years, I have been working as tech lead and senior Scala software engineer in cross-functional product teams, designing and implementing several business-critical backend systems in response to user and product needs, fostering  across the organisation a genuine culture of pragmatism, incremental development, accountability, ownership, and leveraging my strong engineering skills 
 % design principles, functional programming, CI/CD practices, telemetry, TDD and more 
  to develop production-grade systems at scale. Fast feedback loop is not just a good practice for me: it has always been part of my lifestyle.

  My interests range from strongly statically typed purely functional programming, to architecture of concurrent and distributed systems, to Bayesian inference, and recently formal specication tools like TLA+. These (and others) are powerful weapons in my toolkit to confidently deliver robust, reliable, correct software and impactful results at pace. 

My background as a physicist, my diversified experiences and my strategic thinking make me a valuable asset to approach challenging and ambitious tasks. I'm looking for adventures where I can be hands on and help solving real problems and where I can grow and learn new things while helping the business and the team to successfully achieve their goals.
