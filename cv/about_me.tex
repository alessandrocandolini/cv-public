\cvsection{About me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
Theoretical physicist with heavy mathematical and statistical 
background, smart at problem-solving, passionate and skilled in software engineering. 
I'm always looking for the the best tradeoffs between engineering and business needs, and I see engineering as a partner of business. 

  In the last years I have been working primarily as Scala software engineer and tech lead in a cross-functional product team, working in tandem with product, leading by examples, designing, implementing and looking after a number of business-critical backend systems from ideation to post-production, always encouraging across the whole organisation a culture of incremental development, accountability, and ownership, and making informed and effective usage of design principles, functional programming, CI/CD, telemetry, architecture and TDD to drive the development of production-grade backend systems at scale. 

  My current interests range from strongly statically typed purely functional programming to concurrency and distributed systems, to formal specification tools like TLA+, to Bayesian inference. These (among others) are not just intellectual curiosities, but also weapons in my toolkit to deliver confidently robust software at pace. 

My background as a physicist and my diversified work experiences make me a valueable asset to approach challenging tasks. 
My ideal job would involve working in a stimulating team willing to do things properly, where
can play a key role helping the company to grow their business and at the same time
where I have the opportunity to improve myself and my skills.
