I am an Italian theoretical particle physicist with heavy mathematical
background, problem-solving attitude, and passion for statistical data
analysis, simulation and software development.
My current interest is in data science and I am looking for a position sitting at the crossroad
between 
modern machine learning algorithms, traditional statistics and the computational
challenges of writing code to process effectively massive datasets. 
I firmly believe in the future of this exiting and highly cross-disciplinary field and at the same time I think it is
close to my academic background  and fits my skills. 
My ideal job would involve working in a stimulating, innovative,
team where I can give
valuable insights that help the 
company to grow  and at the same time where I have the opportunity  to
improve myself and my knowledge.
