\cvsection{About me}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I am an Italian theoretical physicist with heavy mathematical and statistical 
background, smart at problem-solving, and truly passionate about all stages of software engineering. 
While 
I'm confident enough to
deliver 
fast solutions at pace
if/when
required, 
I am a precise person and whenever possible I prefer to do things the way they
should be done.
In the last years I have been working mainly as Android software engineer,  developing production-ready apps 
	focusing on design principles, clean code, architecture and testability.
 However, I enjoy  working in a dynamic
environment 
 where I can also keep an eye on (and borrow ideas and technology from) emerging trends and technologies in related
fields (eg, backend or recent trends in javascript functional patterns for frontend). 
 I firmly
believe in the future of highly cross-disciplinary fields.
My ideal job would involve working in a stimulating, innovative team where I
can play a key role helping the company to grow their business and at the same time
where I have the opportunity to improve myself and my skills.
