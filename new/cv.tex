\quote{
I am an Italian theoretical physicist with heavy mathematical 
background, problem-solving attitude, and passion for software development, statistical data analysis,
and modern technology. My current interests range from functional
programming languages, to TDD, to IOT and data science and
I am looking for a position sitting at the crossroad between modern 
algorithms, new technology and the computational challenges of
writing code which is beautiful, efficient and reliable.  
I firmly
believe in the future of highly cross-disciplinary fields. 
My ideal job would involve working in a stimulating, challenging, innovative, team where I
can give valuable insights that help the company to grow  and at the same time
where I have the opportunity  to improve myself and my knowledge.
