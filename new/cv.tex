\quote{
I am an Italian theoretical particle physicist with heavy mathematical
background, problem-solving attitude, and passion for statistical data analysis,
simulation and software development.  My current interest is in data science and
I am looking for a position sitting at the crossroad between modern machine
learning algorithms, traditional statistics,   new technology and the computational challenges of
writing code for reliable and efficient processing of massive datasets.  I firmly
believe in the future of this exiting and highly cross-disciplinary field and at
the same time I think it is close to my academic background  and fits my skills.
My ideal job would involve working in a stimulating, innovative, team where I
can give valuable insights that help the company to grow  and at the same time
where I have the opportunity  to improve myself and my knowledge.
